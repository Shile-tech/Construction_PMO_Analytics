# 🏗️ Construction Project Performance Analytics

 Turning construction project data into decisions, a full analytics pipeline using SQL Server and Excel.

SQL and Excel analysis of 50 construction projects across Nigeria uncovering cost overrun drivers, schedule delay patterns, and contractor performance to support data driven project management decisions.

## 📌 Project Background

Infrastructure projects in Nigeria and across much of the developing world routinely suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays, and inconsistent contractor performance. Yet most Project Management Offices (PMOs) lack structured data analysis to understand 'why' this happens or 'where' to intervene.

This project simulates the work of a data analyst embedded in a Nigerian construction PMO. Using a structured dataset of 50 projects across 10 states, the analysis moves from raw data to actionable recommendations that project managers and executives can act on.

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered

1. Which projects had the highest cost and schedule overruns and what drove them?
2. Which project phases are the biggest risk areas for budget blowout?
3. Does contractor selection predict project performance?
4. What early warning signs indicate a project is heading for trouble?
5. Where should a PMO focus its improvement efforts?

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of three related tables:

| Table | Rows | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Projects` | 50 | Master project records — budget, cost, schedule, status |
| `Phase_Breakdown` | 300 | Cost breakdown across 6 project phases per project |
| `Contractor_Scorecard` | 10 | Aggregated contractor performance metrics |

**Key fields:** `budget_NGN`, `actual_cost_NGN`, `cost_overrun_NGN`, `sched_delay_months`, `prim_delay_reas`, `status`, `perct_completed`

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Cost Overrun Rate:** 94% of projects (47 out of 50) exceeded their approved budgets
- **Total Net Cost Overrun:** ₦15.1 billion across the entire portfolio
- **Highest Individual Overrun:** PRJ-005 (Kano Erosion Control Phase 2) -- ₦842.8M over budget (54.1% overrun)
- **Most Risk-Prone Phase:** Procurement -- averaging 24.1% cost overrun, the highest of all 6 project phases
- **Worst Performing Contractor:** Horizon Builders -- performance score of 25.7% across 10 projects (31.4% avg cost overrun, 42.9% avg duration overrun)
- **Best Performing Contractor:** Grandeur Works -- performance score of 53.0% with the lowest avg cost overrun (18.8%)
- **Average Schedule Delay:** 10.4 months across all active projects
- **Top Delay Driver:** Funding delays, contractor defaults, and poor site supervision are the most frequent causes of high-risk project outcomes
